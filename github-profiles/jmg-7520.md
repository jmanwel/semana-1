## Homework1

1. üçé difference between "Terminal Application" y "Terminal Emulator"
A terminal is simply a text-based interface to the computer. In a terminal, you can type commands, manipulate files, execute programs, and open documents. When working in a terminal, the current directory is called your working directory. A terminal will usually start in the top-level directory of your account.
A terminal emulator is a software application that replicates the functionalities of classic computer terminals.

mv moves the files into that directory and gives them names that match the final components of the source path names. When you specify a single source file and the target is not a directory, mv moves the source to the new name, by a simple rename if possible.
